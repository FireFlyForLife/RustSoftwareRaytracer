## Building
I use rust-SDL2, so you have to add the library directory `external` to your LIB environment variable. The commands are also put in `BuildProject.ps1` and `BuildProject.cmd`.

I use time features which are experimental. so to compile add +nightly to your cargo command (`cargo +nightly build`).
